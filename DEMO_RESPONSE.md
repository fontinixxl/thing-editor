- **Educational value** with detailed code comments

### ✅ Technical Excellence

#### Architecture Highlights
```typescript
// Example: Custom component with editor integration
export default class Player extends DSprite {
    @editable({ min: 0, max: 1000 })
    speed = 300;
    
    // Full movement, shooting, collision detection
}
```

#### Scene Management
```typescript
// Example: Scene controller with navigation
export default class MenuScene extends Scene {
    onShow() {
        const playButton = this.findChildByName('playButton');
        if (playButton) {
            playButton.onClick = () => game.showScene('game');
        }
    }
}
```

## What Makes This Special

2. **Production Quality**: Proper error handling, cleanup, organization
3. **Educational Value**: Well-documented for learning purposes
4. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new features and content
5. **Real Game Experience**: Complete, playable game from start to finish

## Deliverables

### Files Created
- ✅ Complete game project in `/thing-editor/demo/space-defender/`
- ✅ Copied to `/games/space-defender/` for editor integration
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (README, technical overview, setup guide)

### Features Demonstrated
